Welcome to the scilpy documentation!
======================================

scilpy is a comprehensive library that provides tools and scripts for processing, analyzing, and visualizing diffusion MRI and tractography data.
It supports advanced features such as tensor- and multi-tensor modeling, streamline registration/transformations, bundle analysis, and more.
Use scilpy to build custom diffusion pipelines or apply ready-to-use scripts.
The documentation is organized into the following sections: 

1. **Getting started & installation** — how to install, set up environments, and run a basic example
2. **Modules & API reference** — detailed descriptions of classes functions and modules
3. **Scripts & workflows** — ready scripts for common tasks
