Compute a connectivity matrix from a tractogram and a parcellation.

Current strategy is to keep the longest streamline segment connecting 2
regions. If the streamline crosses other gray matter regions before reaching
its final connected region, the kept connection is still the longest. This is
robust to compressed streamlines.

The output file is a hdf5 (.h5) where the keys are 'LABEL1_LABEL2' and each
group is composed of 'data', 'offsets' and 'lengths' from the array_sequence.
The 'data' is stored in VOX/CORNER for simplicity and efficiency. See script
scil_tractogram_convert_hdf5_to_trk.py to convert to a list of .trk bundles.

For the --outlier_threshold option the default is a recommended good trade-off
for a freesurfer parcellation. With smaller parcels (brainnetome, glasser) the
threshold should most likely be reduced.

Good candidate connections to QC are the brainstem to precentral gyrus
connection and precentral left to precentral right connection, or equivalent
in your parcellation.

NOTE: this script can take a while to run. Please be patient.
Example: on a tractogram with 1.8M streamlines, running on a SSD:
- 15 minutes without post-processing, only saving final bundles.
- 30 minutes with full post-processing, only saving final bundles.
- 60 minutes with full post-processing, saving all possible files.
