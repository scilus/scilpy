usage: scil_connectivity_print_filenames.py [-h] [-v [{DEBUG,INFO,WARNING}]]

                                            in_matrix labels_list out_txt

Output the list of filenames using the coordinates from a binary connectivity
matrix. Typically used to move around files that are considered valid after
the scil_connectivity_filter.py script.

Example:
# Keep connections with more than 1000 streamlines for 100% of a population
scil_connectivity_filter.py filtering_mask.npy
    --greater_than */streamlines_count.npy 1000 1.0
scil_connectivity_print_filenames.py filtering_mask.npy
    labels_list.txt pass.txt
for file in $(cat pass.txt);
    do mv ${SOMEWHERE}/${FILE} ${SOMEWHERE_ELSE}/;
done

Formerly: scil_print_connectivity_filenames.py

positional arguments:
  in_matrix             Binary matrix in numpy (.npy) format.
                        Typically from scil_connectivity_filter.py
  labels_list           List saved by the decomposition script.
  out_txt               Output text file containing all filenames.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v [{DEBUG,INFO,WARNING}]
                        Produces verbose output depending on the provided level. 
                        Default level is warning, default when using -v is info.
  -f                    Force overwriting of the output files.
