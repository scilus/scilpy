    Parameters

        a ndarray containing the weighting factor

    data : ndarray
        the ndarray containing the data for which the stats are desired

    """
    Returns the mean value of each metric, only considering voxels that
    are crossed by streamlines. The mean values are weighted by the number of
    streamlines crossing a voxel by default. If false, every voxel traversed
    by a streamline has the same weight.

    Parameters
    ------------
    streamlines : sequence
        sequence of T streamlines. One streamline is an ndarray of shape
        (N, 3), where N is the number of points in that streamline, and
        ``streamlines[t][n]`` is the n-th point in the t-th streamline. Points
        are of form x, y, z in voxmm coordinates.

    metrics_files : sequence
        list of nibabel objects representing the metrics files

    density_weighting : bool
        weigh by the mean by the density of streamlines going through the voxel

    Returns
    ---------
    stats : list
        list of tuples where the first element of the tuple is the mean
        of a metric, and the second element is the standard deviation
