def fibertube_density(sft, samples_per_voxel_axis, verbose=False):
    """
    Estimates the per-voxel volumetric density of a set of fibertubes. In other
    words, how much space is occupied by fibertubes and how much is emptiness.

    1. Segments voxels that contain at least a single fibertube.
    2. Valid voxels are finely sampled and we count the number of samples that
    landed within a fibertube. For each voxel, this number is then divided by
    its total amount of samples.
    3. By doing the same steps for samples that landed within 2 or more
    fibertubes, we can create a density map of the fibertube collisions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sft: StatefulTractogram
        Stateful Tractogram object containing the fibertubes.
    samples_per_voxel_axis: int
        Number of samples to be created along a single axis of a voxel. The
        total number of samples in the voxel will be this number cubed.
    verbose: bool
        Whether the function and sub-functions should be verbose.

    Returns
    -------
    density_grid: ndarray
        Per-voxel volumetric density of fibertubes as a 3D image.
    density_flat: list
        Per-voxel volumetric density of fibertubes as a list, containing only
        the voxels that were valid in the binary mask (i.e. that contained
        fibertubes). This is useful for calculating measurements on the
        various density values, like mean, median, etc.
    collision_grid: ndarray
        Per-voxel density of fibertube collisions.
    collision_flat: list
        Per-voxel density of fibertubes collisions as a list, containing only
